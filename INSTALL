Like any other piece of software (and information generally),
tcpanalog comes with NO WARRANTY.


Things you have to decide before starting:

 * The tcpanalog bin directory, normally /usr/local/bin/tcpanalog.
    (To change this directory, edit Makefile now.)

How to install:

 1. Create the tcpanalog scripts:
      $ make
 2. Create the bin directory:
      # make install


How to run:

 3. Make sure that tcpserver's log contains microsecond timestamps; e.g.,
      891369186.031284 tcpserver: pid 14363 ...
      891369186.121287 tcpserver: ok 14363 ...
      891369187.107080 tcpserver: end 14363 ...
    The multilog of daemontools can provide TAI64N timestamps.
    You must convert TAI64N timestamps to TAI timestamps.
 4. Feed tcpserver's log through tcpanalog/tcpmatchup:
      $ /usr/local/bin/tcpanalog/tcpmatchup < /service/smtpd/log/main/* > out
    You must have awk in your path.
 5. Feed the tcpmatchup output through any of the tcpanalog/z* scripts.
    Each script explains its output.
